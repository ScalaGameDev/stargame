  <h1>How to play</h1>
  <p>stargame is a real-time space 4X game. It can be set to be played in real time, or over a period of weeks, depending on the game speed setting.</p>
  <p>The objective of the game is to control 75% of the stars on the map.</p>

  <h2>Joining or starting a game</h2>
  <p>
  Create a new game and send your friend the URL to have them join your game. The game doesn't start until
  the game owner clicks the start button. Empty player slots will be filled with AI that never do anything.
  </p>
  <h2>Money, income, and technology</h2>
  <p>
  Income is derived from planets in star systems you control. When you select a star system, you can see how 
  much income it is producing. Income produced is a function of planetary population and the planet's
  mineral wealth level.</p>
  <p>More hostile planets such as Volcanic planets have both lower max population, and a
  higher level of income per population, due to its higher levels of mineral wealth.</p>
  <p>You can spend your money on reseaching new technology and building ships.</p>
  <h2>Your four actions</h2>
  <p>There are only four actions each player can take. They are: 
    dispatching a fleet,
    building a factory,
    building a ship,
    and researching a technology. These actions make up the whole game.</p>
  <h3>Dispatching ships</h3>
  <p>
  To explore surrounding star systems, colonize them, or take over rival colonies, dispatch (move) 
  your ships onto the star system.</p>

  </p>
  <h3>Building more ships and factories</h3>
  <p>
  To build more ships, you need factories on the star system. Each factory costs 100 RU and can produce
  one ship per year. Each ship costs 10 RU and is produced over time. You can see how many ships are currently
  in the queue for building. Be careful, once built or ordered, the factories cannot be sold. Also, factories
  can fall into the hands of rival empires if they are not guarded.

  <h3>Research</h3>

  <p>
  You may have noticed that most planets are not colonized. This is because most planets require advanced
  technology to settle. You may buy this advanced technology in the Research window, along with ship
  battle upgrades, sensor upgrades, max population upgrades, population growth upgrades, etc.</p>
